Start: The program begins by running the main method, which calls the average() method.

Get Scores: In the average() method, the program asks you to enter two test scores using the keyboard.

Calculate Average: After you enter the scores, the program adds them together and divides by two to find the average. This is done in the calculations() method.

Determine Grade: The program then checks the average and assigns a letter grade:

Show Result: Finally, the program displays the average score and the corresponding letter grade on the screen.
